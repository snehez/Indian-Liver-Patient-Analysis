# Indian Liver Patient Analysis

This project explores the **Indian Liver Patient Dataset** with a focus on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling.  
The goal is to identify clinical factors linked to liver disease and build models for disease prediction.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values and standardized patient-level data  
2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Age & Gender distributions  
   - Treatment success/failure distribution  
   - Cost trends (bilirubin as proxy)  
   - Liver disease vs healthy patients  
   - Clinical variable correlations (heatmap)  
   - Box/violin/scatter plots for biomarkers  
3. **Statistical Testing** – significance tests on bilirubin, albumin, enzymes  
4. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression & Random Forest  
   - ROC curve analysis  
   - Feature importance ranking

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 🎯 Insights
- Older patients have higher risk of liver disease  
- Bilirubin is a strong indicator of liver disease  
- Albumin is negatively correlated with disease status  
- Random Forest achieved higher accuracy than Logistic Regression
